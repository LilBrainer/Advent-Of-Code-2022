# Advent of Code 2022



## Getting started

First of all, i don't really know how to do this... So don't blame me so much :P

In this repository i will try to finish this year of Advent of Code. It's my first time doing it so, maybe it's the worst code you could see.

## Why on C#?

Basically it's the language are we learning on class, so is the language i know. 

I know a little bit of Python, but i forgot almost everything.
